# The Manifest file is used to define the clients metadata
# like the identifier, version, and logo, and will be send
# to the arkitekt serve to register the client.
# In the Manifest you can also describe the API version requirements that the
# arkitekt server must meet to be able to run the client (we currently only have
# one API version, so this is not necessary at the moment to overwrite defautls).
